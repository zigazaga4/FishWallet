      "env": {
        "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "${input:apiKey}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

#### Required for Cloud API

- `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`: Your Firecrawl API key
  - Required when using cloud API (default)
  - Optional when using self-hosted instance with `FIRECRAWL_API_URL`
- `FIRECRAWL_API_URL` (Optional): Custom API endpoint for self-hosted instances
  - Example: `https://firecrawl.your-domain.com`
  - If not provided, the cloud API will be used (requires API key)

#### Optional Configuration

##### Retry Configuration

- `FIRECRAWL_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS`: Maximum number of retry attempts (default: 3)
- `FIRECRAWL_RETRY_INITIAL_DELAY`: Initial delay in milliseconds before first retry (default: 1000)
- `FIRECRAWL_RETRY_MAX_DELAY`: Maximum delay in milliseconds between retries (default: 10000)
- `FIRECRAWL_RETRY_BACKOFF_FACTOR`: Exponential backoff multiplier (default: 2)

##### Credit Usage Monitoring

- `FIRECRAWL_CREDIT_WARNING_THRESHOLD`: Credit usage warning threshold (default: 1000)
- `FIRECRAWL_CREDIT_CRITICAL_THRESHOLD`: Credit usage critical threshold (default: 100)

### Configuration Examples

For cloud API usage with custom retry and credit monitoring:

```bash
# Required for cloud API
export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-api-key

# Optional retry configuration
export FIRECRAWL_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS=5        # Increase max retry attempts
export FIRECRAWL_RETRY_INITIAL_DELAY=2000    # Start with 2s delay
export FIRECRAWL_RETRY_MAX_DELAY=30000       # Maximum 30s delay
export FIRECRAWL_RETRY_BACKOFF_FACTOR=3      # More aggressive backoff

# Optional credit monitoring
export FIRECRAWL_CREDIT_WARNING_THRESHOLD=2000    # Warning at 2000 credits
export FIRECRAWL_CREDIT_CRITICAL_THRESHOLD=500    # Critical at 500 credits
```

For self-hosted instance:

```bash
# Required for self-hosted
export FIRECRAWL_API_URL=https://firecrawl.your-domain.com

# Optional authentication for self-hosted
export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-api-key  # If your instance requires auth

# Custom retry configuration
export FIRECRAWL_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS=10
export FIRECRAWL_RETRY_INITIAL_DELAY=500     # Start with faster retries
```

### Usage with Claude Desktop

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-firecrawl": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "firecrawl-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",

        "FIRECRAWL_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS": "5",
        "FIRECRAWL_RETRY_INITIAL_DELAY": "2000",
        "FIRECRAWL_RETRY_MAX_DELAY": "30000",
        "FIRECRAWL_RETRY_BACKOFF_FACTOR": "3",

        "FIRECRAWL_CREDIT_WARNING_THRESHOLD": "2000",
        "FIRECRAWL_CREDIT_CRITICAL_THRESHOLD": "500"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### System Configuration

The server includes several configurable parameters that can be set via environment variables. Here are the default values if not configured:

```typescript
const CONFIG = {
  retry: {
    maxAttempts: 3, // Number of retry attempts for rate-limited requests
    initialDelay: 1000, // Initial delay before first retry (in milliseconds)
    maxDelay: 10000, // Maximum delay between retries (in milliseconds)
    backoffFactor: 2, // Multiplier for exponential backoff
  },
  credit: {
    warningThreshold: 1000, // Warn when credit usage reaches this level
    criticalThreshold: 100, // Critical alert when credit usage reaches this level
  },
};
```

These configurations control:

1. **Retry Behavior**

   - Automatically retries failed requests due to rate limits
   - Uses exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the API
   - Example: With default settings, retries will be attempted at:
     - 1st retry: 1 second delay
     - 2nd retry: 2 seconds delay
     - 3rd retry: 4 seconds delay (capped at maxDelay)

2. **Credit Usage Monitoring**
   - Tracks API credit consumption for cloud API usage
   - Provides warnings at specified thresholds
   - Helps prevent unexpected service interruption
   - Example: With default settings:
     - Warning at 1000 credits remaining
     - Critical alert at 100 credits remaining

### Rate Limiting and Batch Processing

The server utilizes Firecrawl's built-in rate limiting and batch processing capabilities:

- Automatic rate limit handling with exponential backoff
- Efficient parallel processing for batch operations
- Smart request queuing and throttling
- Automatic retries for transient errors

## Available Tools

### 1. Scrape Tool (`firecrawl_scrape`)

Scrape content from a single URL with advanced options.

**Best for:**

- Single page content extraction, when you know exactly which page contains the information.

**Not recommended for:**

- Extracting content from multiple pages (use batch_scrape for known URLs, or map + batch_scrape to discover URLs first, or crawl for full page content)
- When you're unsure which page contains the information (use search)
- When you need structured data (use extract)

**Common mistakes:**

- Using scrape for a list of URLs (use batch_scrape instead).

**Prompt Example:**

> "Get the content of the page at https://example.com."

**Usage Example:**

```json
{
  "name": "firecrawl_scrape",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "formats": ["markdown"],
    "onlyMainContent": true,
    "waitFor": 1000,
    "timeout": 30000,
    "mobile": false,
    "includeTags": ["article", "main"],
    "excludeTags": ["nav", "footer"],
    "skipTlsVerification": false
  }
}
```

**Returns:**

- Markdown, HTML, or other formats as specified.

### 2. Batch Scrape Tool (`firecrawl_batch_scrape`)

Scrape multiple URLs efficiently with built-in rate limiting and parallel processing.

**Best for:**

- Retrieving content from multiple pages, when you know exactly which pages to scrape.

**Not recommended for:**

- Discovering URLs (use map first if you don't know the URLs)
- Scraping a single page (use scrape)

**Common mistakes:**

- Using batch_scrape with too many URLs at once (may hit rate limits or token overflow)

**Prompt Example:**

> "Get the content of these three blog posts: [url1, url2, url3]."

**Usage Example:**

```json
{
  "name": "firecrawl_batch_scrape",
  "arguments": {
    "urls": ["https://example1.com", "https://example2.com"],
    "options": {
      "formats": ["markdown"],
      "onlyMainContent": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Returns:**

- Response includes operation ID for status checking:

```json
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Batch operation queued with ID: batch_1. Use firecrawl_check_batch_status to check progress."
    }
  ],
  "isError": false
}
```

### 3. Check Batch Status (`firecrawl_check_batch_status`)

Check the status of a batch operation.

```json
{
  "name": "firecrawl_check_batch_status",
  "arguments": {
    "id": "batch_1"
  }
}
```

### 4. Map Tool (`firecrawl_map`)

Map a website to discover all indexed URLs on the site.

**Best for:**

- Discovering URLs on a website before deciding what to scrape
- Finding specific sections of a website

**Not recommended for:**

- When you already know which specific URL you need (use scrape or batch_scrape)
- When you need the content of the pages (use scrape after mapping)

**Common mistakes:**

- Using crawl to discover URLs instead of map

**Prompt Example:**

> "List all URLs on example.com."

**Usage Example:**

```json
{
  "name": "firecrawl_map",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "https://example.com"
  }
}
```

**Returns:**

- Array of URLs found on the site

### 5. Search Tool (`firecrawl_search`)

Search the web and optionally extract content from search results.

**Best for:**

- Finding specific information across multiple websites, when you don't know which website has the information.
- When you need the most relevant content for a query

**Not recommended for:**

- When you already know which website to scrape (use scrape)
- When you need comprehensive coverage of a single website (use map or crawl)

**Common mistakes:**

- Using crawl or map for open-ended questions (use search instead)

**Usage Example:**

```json
{
  "name": "firecrawl_search",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "latest AI research papers 2023",
    "limit": 5,
    "lang": "en",
    "country": "us",
    "scrapeOptions": {
      "formats": ["markdown"],
      "onlyMainContent": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Returns:**

- Array of search results (with optional scraped content)

**Prompt Example:**

> "Find the latest research papers on AI published in 2023."

### 6. Crawl Tool (`firecrawl_crawl`)

Starts an asynchronous crawl job on a website and extract content from all pages.

**Best for:**

- Extracting content from multiple related pages, when you need comprehensive coverage.

**Not recommended for:**

- Extracting content from a single page (use scrape)
- When token limits are a concern (use map + batch_scrape)
- When you need fast results (crawling can be slow)

**Warning:** Crawl responses can be very large and may exceed token limits. Limit the crawl depth and number of pages, or use map + batch_scrape for better control.

**Common mistakes:**

- Setting limit or maxDepth too high (causes token overflow)
- Using crawl for a single page (use scrape instead)

**Prompt Example:**

> "Get all blog posts from the first two levels of example.com/blog."

**Usage Example:**

```json
{
  "name": "firecrawl_crawl",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "https://example.com/blog/*",
    "maxDepth": 2,
    "limit": 100,
    "allowExternalLinks": false,
    "deduplicateSimilarURLs": true
  }
}
```

**Returns:**

- Response includes operation ID for status checking:

```json
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Started crawl for: https://example.com/* with job ID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000. Use firecrawl_check_crawl_status to check progress."
    }
  ],
  "isError": false
}
```

### 7. Check Crawl Status (`firecrawl_check_crawl_status`)

Check the status of a crawl job.

```json
{
  "name": "firecrawl_check_crawl_status",
  "arguments": {
    "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
  }
}
```

**Returns:**

- Response includes the status of the crawl job:

### 8. Extract Tool (`firecrawl_extract`)

Extract structured information from web pages using LLM capabilities. Supports both cloud AI and self-hosted LLM extraction.

**Best for:**

- Extracting specific structured data like prices, names, details.

**Not recommended for:**

- When you need the full content of a page (use scrape)
- When you're not looking for specific structured data

**Arguments:**

- `urls`: Array of URLs to extract information from
- `prompt`: Custom prompt for the LLM extraction
- `systemPrompt`: System prompt to guide the LLM
- `schema`: JSON schema for structured data extraction
- `allowExternalLinks`: Allow extraction from external links
- `enableWebSearch`: Enable web search for additional context
- `includeSubdomains`: Include subdomains in extraction

When using a self-hosted instance, the extraction will use your configured LLM. For cloud API, it uses Firecrawl's managed LLM service.
**Prompt Example:**

> "Extract the product name, price, and description from these product pages."

**Usage Example:**

```json
{
  "name": "firecrawl_extract",
  "arguments": {
    "urls": ["https://example.com/page1", "https://example.com/page2"],
    "prompt": "Extract product information including name, price, and description",

      },
      "required": ["name", "price"]
    },
    "allowExternalLinks": false,
    "enableWebSearch": false,
    "includeSubdomains": false
  }
}
```

**Returns:**

- Extracted structured data as defined by your schema

```json
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": {
        "name": "Example Product",
        "price": 99.99,
        "description": "This is an example product description"
